Assignment Task
File Read & Write Challenge:

Create a Python program that:

Reads a file
Writes a modified version of that content into a new file

Error Handling Lab:
Ask the user to enter a filename

Use error handling to:
Catch cases where the file doesn’t exist
Manage other reading errors

Learning Outcome
You’ll learn how to:

Work with file I/O in Python
Implement proper error handling using try-except blocks
Write code that’s reliable and handles unexpected issues

Run the Python Script
Open your terminal or code editor (like VS Code).

Make sure file_modifier.py and sample.txt are in the same folder.

Run the script using:

python file_modifier.py

When prompted, type:
sample.txt

You should see a new file created named modified_sample.txt with all text in uppercase.
